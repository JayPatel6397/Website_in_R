It indicates data are more spread out. A high standard deviation means data is not closely bound to the mean value.\r\nData is not containing close Continuous number for the people died in the United State of America. It has very large range.\r\nAs we can see the range is 0-53242 and we have only 2849 data, This is why we have high standard deviation and large difference between mean and median.\r\nNaturalCause\r\n\r\nr.death['NaturalCause'].describe()\r\ncount     2717.000000\r\nmean      2194.944056\r\nstd       5945.745418\r\nmin          0.000000\r\n25%         70.000000\r\n50%        216.000000\r\n75%       1294.000000\r\nmax      52054.000000\r\nName: NaturalCause, dtype: float64\r\n\r\nThis column tells us about total number of people died in the month of particular year in the United State of America due to natural cause.\r\nFrom the count row we can find that we have 2717 non null values in our data and remaining rows contain null values.\r\nIn this column we can see that the mean value is 2194.944056 and median (50%) is 216, that means our data is right skewed distributed.\r\nWe have the closest mean and median to the all causeâ€™s mean and median. It means the both are having the some what similar numbers for observation.\r\n\r\nStandard deviation of this column is 5945.745418. It indicates data are more spread out. A high standard deviation means data is not closely bound to the mean value.\r\nIt has very close stadard deviation as allcause column which also add support to the statement that they have some identical numbers or nearest numbers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

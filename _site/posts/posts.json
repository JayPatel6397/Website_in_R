Understand how we can interpret the linear equation and with the help of that equation we can predict the price.\r\nUnivariate Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExploring the univariate distribution of the response variable Sale price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we look at the mean and median, median < mean so we can say that our variable is right skewed. But it is not much skewed so we can consider it as normally distributed because in real world we never get perfectly distributed data.\r\nThe reason behind this skewness can be outliers present in the response variable..\r\nFind outlier(s) in your original response variable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have found the we have some outliers present in the data which can be reason for the skewness.\r\nBivariate Analysis\r\nTo do the bivariate analysis we need to find the features which are highly correlated to the response variable that is house price.\r\nHeat Map to find highly correlated features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see top 3 numerical feature that are directly correlated to the response variable.\r\nGr_Liv_Area Above Ground Living Area in sqft\r\nGarage_Area Garage Area in sqft\r\nTotal_Bsmt_SF Total basement Size in sqft\r\nNow, We look at each feature one by one and see if we can improve the relation?\r\nRelation between Sale Price and Above ground living area size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, we can say that we have some positive relation between sale price and Above Ground Living Area.\r\nBut we can see there are some outliers in Above Ground Living Area, which leads to the less weak relation.\r\n\r\nThe Correlation coefficient before removing outliers is 0.7067799\r\nThe Correlation coefficient after removing outliers is 0.7084774\r\nRelation between Sale Price and Size of garage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, we can say that we have some positive relation between sale price and Size of garage.\r\nBut we can see there are some outliers in total basement size, which leads to the less weak relation.\r\n\r\nThe Correlation coefficient before removing outliers is 0.6401383\r\nThe Correlation coefficient after removing outliers is 0.6422716\r\nRelation between Sale Price and Total Basement size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, we can say that we have some positive relation between sale price and total basement size.\r\nBut we can see there are some outliers in total basement size, which leads to the less weak relation.\r\n\r\nThe Correlation coefficient before removing outliers is 0.6325288\r\nThe Correlation coefficient after removing outliers is 0.6632371\r\nConclusion of EDA\r\nAs we have seen so far that our three features have some outliers and by removing them we can get more strong relation which will help to improve performance of the model.\r\nData Modeling\r\nIn this section we are going to learn how to fit a linear model for the each numerical feature we have seen above and how to interpret there equation.\r\nModel 1 (Sale Price and Above ground living area size)\r\nWhen we fit the model, we can see the following values and with the help of that we can form an linear equation.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 5\r\n  term

\r\n\r\n\\(\\hat{y}= 5905.812 + 116.874 \\times Above-ground-living-area-size\\)\r\nY intercept value means that, For a house with 0 Above ground living area size, the house price will be 5905.812 USD.\r\nSlope of the fitted line means that, If we increase Above ground living area size by 1 Sqft, the price of the house increases with 116.874 USD.\r\nModel 2 (Sale Price and Size of garage)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 5\r\n  term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value\r\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\r\n1 (Intercept)   46925.   3341.        14.0 2.40e-

price will be 46925.28 USD.\r\nSlope of the fitted line means that, If we increase Size of garage size by 1 Sqft, the price of the house increases with 277.37 USD.\r\nModel 3 (Sale Price and Total Basement size)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2 x 5\r\n  term          estimate std.error statistic  p.value\r\n  <chr>            <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\r\n1 (Intercept)     35394.   3309.

basement size , the house price will be 35393.94 USD.\r\nSlope of the fitted line means that, If we increase size of total basement by 1 Sqft, the price of the house with 137 USD.\r\nModel

we can see in the table,\r\nModel 1 (Sale price, above ground living area) has 50% variability of sale price based on the above ground living area, which is the highest.\r\nIt has highest adjusted R squared value so we can say it is best.\r\nThe reason why we considered Adjusted R squared value to select best model is that,\r\nAdjusted R - squared value only consider those independent variable which really helps in explaining the dependent variable.\r\nHere, we are using many independent variable with the single dependent variable and we do not know which one is good one to explain the dependent variable so we can use the adjusted R-squared value.\r\nModel Diagnostics\r\nNow that you have chosen our best model, we need to determine if it is reliable or not:\r\nThere are three things to check.\r\nLinearity\r\nDistribution of Residuals\r\nConstant Variability of residuals\r\nCreating two new data columns based on our best model: predicted values for our response variable and the corresponding residuals.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 2,904 x 8\r\n   Sale_Price Gr_Liv_Area .fitted  .resid     .hat .sigma     .cooksd\r\n        <int>       <int>   <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl>
